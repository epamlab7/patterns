PROTOTYPE DESIGN PATTERN
(One of Creational Patterns)

INTENT
Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance,
and create new objects by copying this prototype.

WHEN WOULD WE USE THIS PATTERN?
- Composition, creation and representation of objects should be decoupled from the system;
- Classes to be created are specified at runtime;
- Objects are required that are similar to existing objects;
- You need to hide the complexity of creating new instance from the client;
- Creating an object is an expensive operation and it would be more efficient to copy an object.
