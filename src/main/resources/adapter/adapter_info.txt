ADAPTER DESIGN PATTERN
Allows 2 incompatible interfaces to work together
Used when the client expects a (target) interface
The Adapter class allows the use of the available interface and the Target interface
Any class can work together as long as the Adapter solves the issue that all classes must implement every method defined by the shared interface

Simple example in java:
InputStreamReader translates a byte stream into a character stream.
OutputStreamWriter translates a character stream into a byte stream. These classes exemplify the Adapter pattern.
In particular, they change input/output stream interfaces to the required reader/writer interfaces.
