OBSERVER DESIGN PATTERN]
(One of the behavioral design pattern)

INTENT
The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between a subject
and any number of observer so that when the subject object changes state,
all its dependents are notified and updated automatically!

WHEN WOULD WE USE THIS PATTERN?
- Relationship between subject and observer is one-to-many;
- The subject does not know exactly how many observer it has;
- Subject should be able to notify itâ€™s observers without knowing who these observers are.
