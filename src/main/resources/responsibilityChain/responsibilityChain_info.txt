Intent:
It avoids attaching the sender of a request to its receiver, giving this way other objects the possibility of handling the request too.
The objects become parts of a chain and the request is sent from one object to another across the chain until one of the objects will handle it.

Using Chain of Responsibility?
More than one object can handle a command
The handler is not known in advance
The handler should be determined automatically
Itâ€™s wished that the request is addressed to a group of objects without explicitly specifying its receiver
The group of objects that may handle the command must be specified in a dynamic way

Example:
In current example we have three classes which extends abstract class VacancyHandler.
Which has two methods:
handleRequest() - which input message and handle it
setSuccessor() - which make chain of objects
First we generate message that goes to the chain of objects. Object in the that can handle it print message
if object cant handle message than it send it to the next successor in the chain.
