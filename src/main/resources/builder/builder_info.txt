The Builder is a design pattern designed to provide a flexible solution to various object creation problems in object-oriented programming. Intent is separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

Example with cars:
We have a Car class. The problem is that a car has many options. The combination of each option would lead to a huge list of constructors for this class. So we will create a builder class, CarBuilder. We will send to the CarBuilder each car option step by step and then construct the final car with the right options.
So this indicates that the Builder pattern is more than just a means to limit constructor proliferation. It removes what could be a complex building process from being the responsibility of the user of the object that is built. It also allows for inserting new implementations of how an object is built without disturbing the client code.
