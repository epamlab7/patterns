Proxy is a structural design pattern that lets you provide a substitute or placeholder
for another object to control access to it.
Proxy pattern is used when we need to create a wrapper to cover the main objectâ€™s
complexity from the client.

Current example:
Internet, which restricts few site access. The proxy first checks the host you are connecting to,
if it is not part of restricted site list, then it connects to the real internet.
